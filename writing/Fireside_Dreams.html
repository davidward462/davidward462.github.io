<h1>Fireside Dreams</h1>

<p>February, 1958.</p>

<p>I have never been able to fully reason with the horror that I witnessed those four years ago. Even though I long for a rational explanation, I know I will never find one. No amount of tireless research will give me a way to sleep soundly, or to ignorantly disregard the unknowable evil that resides in the darkest corners of the world.</p>

<p>The first two days of the hike had gone by exceedingly well. Our hearts and minds felt free and unburdened in the Oregon wilderness. The emerald green forest blanketed the surrounding hills, and long tendrils of moss hung from the nearby trees. Here, the chaos and noise of the city was so far away it may as well not even exist. Instead our ears were filled with the gentle rustle of cedar branches in the warm June air, and the soothing sounds of hidden songbirds.</p> 

<p>While this particular trip was one of the most difficult we had undertaken, my friends and I were quite experienced and did not worry. My group, which consisted of myself, Andrew Case, and Wallace Greer, had met in freshman year at the University of Oregon. With a common interest in nature and adventure, we decided to have camping and hiking trips as often as we could, to relax and relieve the stress of our studies.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon when came upon a small rushing stream, and after discovering a decaying but ultimately stable fallen tree to serve as a bridge, Andrew and I were beginning to cross when we heard Wallace call out from behind us.</p>

<p>“Come, look at this!” he said, quickly. 
I turned around and saw Wallace, who had wandered some ways away to a small clearing. He was staring at something that was hidden behind a moss-covered tree. I began to walk towards him.
From halfway across the fallen tree-bridge, Andrew called out, “What is it? I can’t see from here.”
Wallace took a moment to think. “It’s a big stone… ” He trailed off.
“Yeah, so?” I asked curtly as approached him. </p>

<p>As I walked past the tree, I understood his confusion. Lodged into the spongy moss in front of us was a vaguely rectangular piece of rock, as long as any of us were tall, and about half as wide. It came to knee height, and was covered in various mosses and lichen, as well as a fungus that reminded me of rotting meat. It sat at a slight angle, as if it had been dropped from a great height and had become lodged in the soft earth. However, the sharpness of its corners and edges, though obviously dulled by the elements, gave it a distinctly man-made look.</p> 

<p>“Is it concrete?” I asked, continuing to look over the block’s surface. I knew we were several days away from the nearest town, and we had not seen any signs of construction since then.</p>

<p>“No,” Andrew began, “its stone, not concrete. See, look here.” He pointed to an exposed area that bore a resemblance only to natural rock.</p>
	
<p>“What do you think it’s from?” Wallace chimed in.</p>

<p>A thought came into my head. “Maybe…” I stood up and looked around in all directions. Andrew and Wallace exchanged glances.</p> 

<p>I walked a circle around the relic, staring at the ground.</p> 
<p>“What?” Wallace asked, frowning.</p>
<p>“It’s probably part of some old structure,” I looked back at the stone. “So there might be other parts nearby.” Andrew seemed like he was about to speak, but then began to search as well. Wallace joined in, wordlessly.</p>

<p>After only a minute or two it was obvious there was nothing as notable as the carved stone anywhere nearby.</p> 
<p>“I don’t get it. What the hell is this thing for?” I was bewildered.</p> 
<p>Andrew knelt beside it, and carefully cleared away some of the moss with a stick.</p> 
<p>“Can you see something there?” Andrew looked upwards at Wallace and me. I moved closer and squatted beside him.</p>
<p>“It looks like there might have been some carvings on it, right here. See?” He gestured with the stick, but I only squinted.</p> 

<p>He continued. “I think there’s a line along here, and maybe some sort of swirl…”
I stood back up. “I don’t know, I don’t really see much there.” 
Andrew lingered wordlessly for a moment longer and then got to his feet. “What do you think Wallace?” We both looked over and found Wallace staring at the block. After a moment he made eye contact with us. “What was that?”
“I said, what do you think it is?”
“Oh, well, I’m not sure. Could be anything, really.” Wallace looked to us for a moment and then back to the object in question. 
I began to walk back to the trail. “Come on, we still have a while more to go before evening.”</p>

<p>We had finished setting up camp just as the sun sank behind the western hills, bloodying the sky and clouds. The crisp chill of summer nights had begun to seep into the air, and Wallace swiftly started a campfire. It’s warmth and mesmerizing glow gave us a familiar comfort, and we sat in a friendly silence. We had been more quiet than usual after leaving the stone, but as we ate I noticed Andrew and Wallace appeared more relaxed now, and I felt the same. After the meal we talked as we had on any previous camping trip, and there was no mention of our earlier discovery.</p> 

<p>As the fiery reds and oranges of sunset melted away, the sky became a black ocean, hiding unknown shadows beyond its inverted surface. The stars shined brighter here, their silver light unpolluted by the artificial lights of the city. The fire exhausted itself and became shadowy coals, alive with crawling embers. I do not know how my friends felt at that time, but in the back of my mind as I lay on my bedroll in the night air, I listened for any sounds in the darkness.</p>

<p>My sleep that night was broken with dreams of disturbingly grotesque shapes and landscapes that I did not know. However, some images were recognizable to me. I saw a small mountain, one side flattened distinctly with a near vertical cliff. There was a lake nestled under the dark shadows of the trees. In this dream, I approached the base of the mountain, and found a crack in the cliff which led down into absolute darkness. In the last moment of this nightmare, as I stared into that abyss, I felt a feeling of total hopelessness and fear beyond anything I had ever experienced.</p>

<p>I woke up in a cold sweat. For a moment I still saw the terrible abyss before me, but it quickly faded and became only a blurry memory.</p> 
<p>As I stood up, I saw Andrew crouched beside the campfire, his back towards me.</p> 
<p>“Sleep well?” I asked, hoping the residual dream fear would not be heard in my voice.</p>
<p>“What? Oh, good morning Charlie.” Andrew’s voice sounded distracted. “The night was alright, but I had an awfully strange dream.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” A began, now curious. “What was so strange?”</p>
<p>“Well, I was alone in a forest, like this,” He gestured quickly to the nearby trees. “And I saw you standing in front of some cave, or tunnel maybe. And it was so vivid, too. I could smell the moss and rotten logs, feel the cold air on my face.”</p>
<p>The friendly smile left my face. “You’re sure that was your dream?” I spoke deliberately.</p> 
<p>Andrew frowned. “ Yeah, I’m sure. Don’t remember anything else.”</p>
<p>I was unsure how to explain, and held my tongue for a few seconds. “That was...my dream too. I saw a cave.” </p>
<p>Andrew frowned. “Ok, people sometimes have-” I cut him off.</p> 
<p>“Where was the cave?”</p>
<p>“Like I said, in a forest-“</p>
<p>“No, I mean where was it situated. What was around it? Was it at the bottom of a cliff? Was there a lake?”</p>
<p>Andrew’s face changed from confusion to concern. “Yes…yeah, there was.”</p> 
<p>I took a breath. “You see what I’m saying now?” I was trying to make sense of this, but I had no explanation. “You say you saw me, Right? You know it was me?”</p>
<p>Andrew sat back on a log and put his hand on his chin. “I’m certain it was you. It looked like you, and I had this feeling like I knew it was you.”</p>
<p>I still failed to rationalize any of this. “Where’s Wallace?”</p>
<p>I turned towards his sleeping bag, but even before my gaze fell totally upon it, I could see it was crumpled and empty. Andrew and I walked towards the edges of the clearing, staring into the forest. I wanted to discuss these dreams with Wallace so badly that I was prepared to march into the cool morning shadows of the trees to search for him. Suddenly hearing the crackling of brush behind me, I turned around and saw Wallace emerging from the bushes.</p>

<p>“Mornin’ fellas,” he said, cheerily. “Are you looking for something?”</p>
<p>I began walking quickly towards him. “Yeah, we were looking for you. What were you doing out there?” I gestured to the mysterious greens of the forest behind Wallace.</p>

<p>“I was just, you know, relieving myself.” he said, a little uncomfortably. “And I thought an early morning walk would be enjoyable.”</p>
<p>“Did you have a dream last night?”  I asked, ignoring whatever Wallace had just said. </p>
<p>Wallace looked to the ground and scratched the back of his neck. “No, I don’t think so. Don’t remember anything, really.”</p>
<p>“Well,” I began, slowing my breathing. “Andrew and I had…the same dream. I was outside of a cave, near a mountain, and he saw me there."</p> 
<p>Wallace frowned. “That’s a bit strange, don’t you think? Having the same dream?”</p> 
<p>I looked to Andrew, and back again. “No, I was in his dream, get it?”</p>
<p>Wallace eyed us both, and then Andrew spoke up. “It’s true Wallace, we’re not kidding. I can’t explain it, but that’s what we remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what to say to you fellas.” Wallace began, clearly without the look of concern Andrew and I shared. “Sounds a little like Voodoo to me.”</p>
<p>I let out a breath. “Fine I…I don’t know what else to tell you. But we should start packing up, anyways.” I followed Wallace back to camp in silence.</p>


<p>Had I known how our journey would end, I no doubt would have forced us to turn around and leave that place there and then. Not just for the lives of my dear friends, but for my own sanity which surely will never fully recover. Before this living nightmare happened, I was inwardly prideful of my own intelligence, and often thought that I could bear knowledge that those I called ‘average’ could not. But now I know how foolish had been.</p>

<p>The dreams came to me again that night. Once again, I was in front of the cave, but now it was nighttime. I looked upwards and realized with creeping dread that all the constellations were unrecognizable to me. The gentle flowing milky way was replaced with another galaxy, one that cast a subtle violet light, and beside it hung a massive, reddish moon. I turned to look back into the cave. The shadows within it, mere feet from my face, seemed now to have a material quality. It seeped and flowed, viscous and sticky like a sickening oil, from the mouth of the cave. I squinted, peering closer into it, searching; for what, I do not remember. But that search was interrupted by a hellish and blood chilling shriek from deep within the cave.</p>

<p>I awoke with a jolt, a scream held just barely behind my lips. Once again, I was dripping in cold sweat. The sharp terror of the dream passed after a few moments, but the residual horror remained.</p> 
<p>I got up and looked around, seeing the calm morning light around me. Looking at Andrew, I saw him and twitching in his sleeping bag. Nightmares, I thought. I turned to Wallace’s sleeping bag, but found it empty. Probably another morning walk, I thought to myself. But then something caught my eye. Our packs, which had been hoisted partway up a tree to deter animals, were slumped in a pile on the ground. I walked towards it, and upon realizing what was wrong, I froze. Wallace’s pack was gone. Confused thoughts passed through my mind. Was it stolen? If so, why would two be left? Did Wallace go somewhere?</p>

<p>My train of thought was broken by rustling behind me. I turned around, startled. It was only Andrew, now walking towards me from the camp.</p>

<p>“What were you looking at?” He asked, concerned.</p> 
<p>“Wallace is gone,” I blurted out, not sure how to follow up. “And his pack is gone.”</p>
<p>“What? He took it down from the tree?”</p>
<p>I looked at the rope on the ground, which had been severed with a knife. </p>
<p>“It must have been him, our packs are still here.” I responded. “But why would he do that? Where would he go?”</p>
<p>Andrew was silent for a moment, staring into the distance. “Did you dream?” He asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“I did. I was at that cave again, but I heard a scream.” I could replay the sound in my mind as clear as I had heard it from that cave. I felt my arms and neck prickle. “Did you?”</p>

<p>Andrew Nodded, but waited several seconds to speak. “Yes. I was in the cave this time, just past the entrance. Everything was dark at first, but I turned around and saw you standing at the entrance. You were above me though, like I climbed down a ledge to get where I was. At first everything was quiet around me, but then I heard something coming towards me. I tried to move, but I couldn’t. Then I saw it was Wallace running towards me. And right before he got to me, he changed into something else, I don’t know what. And then the thing, Wallace, grabbed me, and it was like it was crushing my bones.”</p>

<p>Andrew looked to the side slightly, but I could see sweat glistening on his pale face.</p>

<p>“I’d never felt pain like that in a dream before, and that’s when I screamed. I don’t know if anything happened after that. I can’t remember.”</p>

<p>I stood still, looking at Andrew with wide eyes. “Well,” I began slowly, regardless of the dream, we have to look for Wallace and make sure he’s okay.”</p> 
<p>Andrew nodded. We walked back to camp and quickly packed our things. Luckily for us, a patch of soft soil showed Wallace’s general direction of travel. He had gotten onto a small trail which worked through the bush until it opened into the wide valley we had been traveling along during the past days. We doused our fire and made our way down the trail.</p> 


<p>As the sun climbed steadily up the clear sky, we trekked across the valley. Strangely, we were able to keep our heading even though Wallace’s heavy boot prints had all but vanished. After about an hour or so, I became aware that I my attention was being pulled to a particular spot on the hills ahead of us. I studied the spot, and the area around it, but saw nothing of interest. I looked at Andrew, who too was staring ahead, but decided to say nothing. The time passed with little conversation. We reached the hills guarding the edge of the valley, and I knew we were getting close. </p>

<p>“What do we do once we get there?” Andrew asked, concerned.</p>
<p>“Well, bring him back, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“You think we’ll make it before night fall?”</p> 
<p>I looked upwards and found the sun had become obscured by a thin layer of clouds, making it appear pale and watery. It was still a ways up above the low hills and mountains surrounding us.</p> 

<p>“I don’t think we have much further to go. We’ll make it.” I spoke without really knowing what I was saying, but I took no issue with it. I didn’t know how much further the cave was, or if we were still indeed following Wallace’s path. Instead, I simply knew we would be there soon, and Wallace would be there.</p> 

<p>The edge of the valley drew closer, and was passed. From the summit of the hill, we saw that this was only the beginning of an even greater expanse of hills, and further on, mountains. But our eyes and minds were drawn to one point only: the dark forest at the base of a mountain just ahead. A mountain with one side a vertical cliff, and at the foot of which I knew with needle-sharp certainty lie the terrible dream-cave.</p>

<p>I stood, and with eyes ahead I spoke, “It’s there, that’s the mountain.”</p>
<p>Andrew replied with a weakening voice. “Let’s keep moving then. We’ve got to make it now. I’m not waiting another night.” We marched solemnly on.</p>

<p>The sun hung low in the sky, and as we descended towards the base of the cliff, I figured it would set before we reached the cave. Strangely, the surrounding woods began to seem familiar, and soon I had the disorienting feeling of déjà vu. As we continued, the feeling only got stronger, to the point the otherworldly scenes from my nightmares replayed over and over in my head, impervious to my efforts to stop them. The viscous blackness of the cave, the strange stars, the scream. It made me want to run and hide, and forget this all forever. But I remained steadfast.</p>

<p>The sun was now hidden behind the hills, the sky transitioning to a pale orange. Ahead of us now, a menacing pit that grinned from the mountainside, was the cave. Without the odd distortion of perspective and thought that often comes with nightmares, I saw the cave more clearly than before. It seemed to go straight into the mountain for a few feet, and then drop off into darkness. I turned to look at Andrew, but his gaze was elsewhere. I followed it and saw Wallace’s pack lying amidst the nearby brambles.</p>
 
<p>“At least we know he’s here.” Andrew said, attempting a joking tone, though I saw no humor in his eyes.</p>
<p>We slowly approached the cave, alert, listening. There were no sounds.</p> 
<p>“Grab your lantern.” I said, as I removed my backpack and began to search through it. “Maybe he’s still alright in there.”</p>
<p>We both lit our lanterns and began the descent into the darkness. For a time there was nothing but rough stony walls as we traversed the steep slope downwards. The path twisted and turned, making our descent difficult. As it went on I noticed that it was oddly round, and I imagined some ungodly earthworm eating through the ancient stone. Deeper down, the sides were covered in a wet, blackish moss. Andrew and I walked in silence, and the only sounds in our ears were shoes on the stone, and the occasional echo of dripping water.</p>

<p>I don’t know how far we descended. but it was likely not as far as the ever-increasing claustrophobia made it seem. Eventually the tunnel widened, and lead into a large cavern which was, to my immediate fright, somewhat lit. As neither Andrew nor I had expected this, we looked around frantically, searching for the source. We finally looked upwards and saw that the ceiling was not of solid stone, but had a large hole in the center. This structure appeared to continue through the entirety of the mountain, leaving a distant spot of fading daylight high above us.</p>
 
<p>In the shimmering lantern light, I caught sight of Andrew with his neck craned upwards.</p> 
<p>“I, I don’t understand.” He said slowly, then looking to me.</p>
<p>I shrugged. “Honestly, I don’t want to know.”</p>
<p>As we walked farther into the cavern the smell of mold and decay became stronger, and the air felt stale and sickly in my lungs.</p>
 
<p>“Wallace?” I called into the blackness. A moment later, a soulless echo returned. I felt uncomfortable calling out into the darkness, but I knew that if Wallace was hiding somewhere in those tunnels, knowledge of our presence would certainly help him. I was about to shout again when I heard Andrew, in a shaky voice, call to me. I turned around and saw that he had wandered a distance away, and he was staring intently at something I could not see. I walked towards him, and as the object came into full view, my stomach became a lump of lead. In front of Andrew was a raised block of stone composed of clearly artificial angles. Resting solemnly atop, to my even greater horror, was a pile of human bones. My mind jumped immediately to the safety of Wallace, but upon closer inspection I realized that these bones were totally dry, and bore stains of moss and mildew.</p>

<p>As we stood in silence, I thought Andrew would make some observation or maybe even a joke about the absurdity of this scene which seemed almost totally unreal, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>After some time, I spoke. “I don’t like this. We shouldn’t be here. We need to find Wallace and leave.”</p>
<p>Andrew turned to me, and for a moment I was taken aback. His skin was as pale as I had ever seen it, and in the sharp shadows of the lamp light the dark patches under his eyes granted him a visage akin to a corpse. Though I had no mirror, I had a feeling my own face bore a similar look. He nodded and opened his mouth to speak, but was cut short by a soft sound. Our eyes met.</p>

<p>“Wallace?” I said, with force.</p>
<p>The sound, which seemed like nearby muttering or speaking, continued. We both broke away from the stone block and moved deeper into the dark, towards the sound.</p>
<p>“Wallace? Can you hear us? Where are you?” We called into the dark but got no intelligible reply. We navigated through the cavern for a minute or two, relying on the steady increase in volume of the mumbling, until we came to a final turn. We stopped one last time, and held our breaths to listen.</p>

<p>I felt some relief when I realized the voice belonged to Wallace, though I could not understand what he was saying. It flowed like a river from the dark, with noticible pattern direction. However strange it was, though, I wanted nothing more than the get my friend and leave as quickly as possible, so Andrew and I rounded the last corner.</p>

<p>The chamber that we came across was so dark that Wallace, who was kneeling in the center of it, was a solitary figure floating in a sea of shadow. His lantern was beside him, but it was dimming. He faced away from us, but we were close enough now that we could hear him quite clearly. To my surprise he was speaking at a fairly loud volume, and it had only been the acoustics of the cave that had made it seem so hushed. However, despite being only a room’s distance from him, I was unable to comprehend anything he said.</p>

<p>“Wallace? Are you...doing alright?” His muttering continued. I turned and looked over my shoulder at Andrew. In cave seemingly as cold as the depths of the ocean, sweat glistened on his face.</p> 
<p>“We’ve got to get out of here Wallace.” Andrew called with a trembling voice. “Charlie and I, we’ve come to get you.” His words had no effect.</p>
<p>“We need to leave,” Andrew continued, “this place isn’t safe.”</p>

<p>Wallace sat still, speaking unintelligibly, as if we didn’t even exist. I gestured for Andrew to follow me as I began walking towards our friend. I had no idea what I would do once I reached him, but my lack of a plan was immediately irrelevant when Wallace suddenly stopped speaking. We were still out of reach, but we froze in our tracks. Then, before anyone could do anything, there was another sound. It came up from a chasm that was mere feet from where Wallace sat, now visible in out lantern light. The sound was awful and stomach churning; Writhing and wet, like a pit of a million worms. And then it was gone.</p>

<p>Wallace looked around, frantic and confused, then called out.</p>
<p>“W-what’s going on? Hello? Where...where am I?”</p> 
<p>“Wallace!” He was startled at the sound of my voice. “It’s me, Charlie, and Andrew. We’ve come to help you.”</p>
 
<p>Despite awakening from whatever trance he had been under, and finding himself in a near pitch black cave, I saw relief on Wallace’s face when he caught sight of us.</p> 
<p>“What happened? Where are we? When-” He was cut off by that terrible noise again, but this time it was closer.</p>
<p>I called over the sound. “We have to leave, now.”</p> 

<p>Wallace got to his feet and just as he took a step, a massive, dark, and twisted shape emerged from the chasm behind him. Almost its entirety was shrouded in darkness, but several black, snake-like legs were visible. They glistened in the dim light, covered by what looked and smelled like putrid, rotting slime. As it climbed up from the chasm, all sanity drained from my mind. The cave itself seemed to sway and twist; angles and distances distorted. I tried to scream, but all that came from my lungs was a faint wheeze. I was unable to move, and I could only watch and listen as the creature grasped Wallace, screaming, and pulled him into the crevasse.</p> 

<p>But this was not enough for the thing that had just emerged from the bowels of the Earth. It continued to climb out and move towards Andrew and I, and it was at that moment when blood and breath returned to my body and I could move again.</p> 
<p>I didn’t think, I just ran. My heartbeat echoed through my head like a sledgehammer. As I entered the chamber where we had found the bones, something in the back of my mind clicked, and I stopped running. I looked around and my stomach dropped as I realized that Andrew wasn’t with me. I was torn. In my mind I pictured Andrew paralyzed with fear as I had been. My mind raced for a moment longer, then I made my decision.</p> 

<p>I turned and began to run back, but after mere moments Andrew’s scream cut through the darkness, followed by a sickening crunch. The noise came like a punch to the stomach, and I fell forwards. The ground seemed to rise and fall under me, like a raft on the ocean, and I was sick on it. Then I stood up and listened. I could hear it now, its horrible worm-legs slopping through the cave, getting closer. The noise, along with the stench, grew, until I knew I had mere moments to escape. I bolted for the tunnel through which I had entered this accursed place. Nearly there, I felt a spike of pain shoot through my knee as I collided with the stone table. I fell to the ground, but I groped for the table and pulled myself to my feet. I ran for the circle of dim moonlight on the wall I knew to be the exit tunnel. I crawled up as fast as I could, picturing in my mind the creature only inches behind me, about to drag me down into an infinitely horrible darkness.</p>
	
<p>Finally, by my own force of will or some miracle, I made it to the surface. But I didn’t stop there. I sprinted from the cave and into the clearing as fast as I could, only stopping when I finally collapsed from exhaustion. Even laying in the forest at night, totally alone and miles away from any civilization, I felt safe. It was like being safe in my own bed compared where I had just been As I laid there, my lungs burning, I finally wrapped my mind around, at least in part, of what just happened. My two best friends were dead, and I had barely escaped an entity which seemed beyond all logic and reasoning. My face crumpled. I cried uncontrollably out of loss, fear, and the sheer insanity of what I had just witnessed.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long I laid there, but some sound brought my attention back. I do not remember what I heard, but as I looked around to figure out what it was, I casually looked to the top of the mountain. There, emerging from the peak, was a shape more horrifying than I had thought possible. A huge black mass of writhing tentacles, shimmering in the blue moonlight, crawled its way down the mountain and into the shadows of the forest.</p>

<h2>My comments</h2>

<p>This was a very on-the-nose attempt at a Lovecraftian story. I first drafted this story in 2017, and when I got around to editing it maybe a year later, I realized the dialogue was unreasonably dramatic. Several years and several edits later, I ifnally finished the story in 2021 and I think it's overall more reasonable. However, this was primarily an exploration of style, which I enjoyed, but the narrative got tedious fairly quickly and I am happy to consider it done.</p>
