	<h2>About this site</h2>

		<p>This site is currently under construction. I'm planning to use it as a place to practice web development, showcase projects, and maybe other stuff. Right now, the index page (this one) will have all the links to the individual content pages. For example, there isn't a directory page specifically for X, but you will find hyperlinks to pages X_1, X_2, etc., on this page. This might change in the future but it's faster to build it that way right now. And there won't be an unreasonable number of pages anyways.</p>

	<h2>About me</h2>

		<p>I'm a third year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria.</p>
